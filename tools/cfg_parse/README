cfg_parse 1.0

cfg_parse is a simple command-line parser

I got sick of the search for something that handles key-value pairs
  gracefully and simply, so I rolled my own.

Inclusion in your own projects is easy: simply copy cfg_parse.h/c to your
  src folder, and compile them right in

See main.c for usage examples.
